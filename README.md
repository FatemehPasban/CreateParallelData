# Create Parallel Data
The goal of this project is to build a parallel Corpus for Loanwords translation.
First, the Hamshahri Corpus and Miras Corpus(news data) are tokenized at the sentence level.
Then, for each Loanword specified by the system in the sentence, the system offers its Persian origin synonyms to the expert.
The expert then selects the most appropriate one. 

At the end, this output sentence and the initial sentence are stored as a pair in a parallel corpus.
